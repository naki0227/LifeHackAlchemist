[🇯🇵 Japanese (日本語)](README.ja.md)

## 📖 Overview

**Lifehack Alchemist** is a **"Stealth Education" RPG** where an underdog protagonist, who can only use "Household Magic", dominates an alternate world by utilizing modern scientific knowledge (Lifehacks).

Players immerse themselves in the fun of laws of physics and chemical reactions through gameplay without feeling like "studying".
Google Gemini API analyzes the player's free combination of "Materials" x "Magic" x "Conditions" and simulates scientifically correct phenomena in real-time.

### 🗺 Story
The stage is a medieval fantasy world where elemental magic is supreme. Reincarnated from modern Japan, the protagonist uses only basic "Household Magic" (Ignition, Cleaning, Drying, Watering).
But he knew. You can enrich uranium with "Cleaning" and cause a dust explosion with "Ignition"...
This is a story of an underdog overturning common sense with scientific knowledge.

## 🎮 Core Loop

1.  **Scavenge:** Pick up "trash" or "common materials" in dungeons.
2.  **Synthesize:** Combine materials with appropriate "living magic" and "conditions" (sealing, compression, etc.).
3.  **AI Judge:** Gemini 2.5 analyzes the combination and simulates scientifically correct phenomena (explosion, freezing, byproducts, etc.).
4.  **Discovery:** Discover new phenomena and unravel the world (and its laws of physics).

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. ⚛️ Generative Physics Engine
There is no fixed "correct answer". The LLM judges the experiment conceived by the player (e.g., flour + closed space + ignition magic) based on laws of physics. Results like "Dust Explosion" are dynamically generated.

### 2. 👾 Pixel Art World
A nostalgic and warm world of 16-bit retro pixel art (SFC style). Behind the scenes, the super-realistic and cold scientific text generated by Gemini creates a unique gap experience.

### 3. 🚫 No Lecture, Just Action
No textbook-like explanatory text. Players naturally acquire scientific thinking by observing the "results" of experiments, inferring "why this happened?", and applying it to the next experiment.
